Moscow, 2015

Hello, my name is **[Interviewer! Introduce yourself]**. The Institute of Sociology of the Russian Academy of Sciences is conducting a survey that set out to collect data on how the economic and political change influence that life of the Russians. We select families in accordance with a special method, so that several thousand interviews allow us to portray with utmost precision the life of our population. It means that we should question the selected members of your household older than 18. 

All information, accumulated by the current study is anonymous. We undertake to never, under no circumstances to name publicly those who take part in our study. All data will by analyzed in general terms.

Your participation in the project is voluntary. However each refusal to participate has a negative effect on the degree of precision. Now our society needs precise information as never before.  Therefore we want you or other member of your family to spend some time and give answers to our questions.

3. Trade-unions should influence only to issues of work-conditions, but not wages

How often do you spend time on the following pastimes? Do it every day, every week, every month, three to six times a year, less frequently, never. Comment by Mikhail Chernysh: well, we have to do something with the options  or the scale. It is impossible to to every day to the library unless you are a librarian. It is hard to go visiting friends every day or drink everyday in the company of friends. I would suggest that we divide pastimes in "frequent" and "infrequent" and divise different scales for them. Going to a cafe, taking sports, playing computer games would be "frequent", admitting of every day engagement. Theater, concert, libraries, guests would be "infrequentl" pastimes. For them we can have "less frequently than once a month, 2-3 times a month, 4-5 times a month, 6-7 times a month, more than 7 times a month.
