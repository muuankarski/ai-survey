<p>Moscow, 2015</p>
<p>Hello, my name is <strong>[Interviewer! Introduce yourself]</strong>. The Institute of Sociology of the Russian Academy of Sciences is conducting a survey that set out to collect data on how the economic and political change influence that life of the Russians. We select families in accordance with a special method, so that several thousand interviews allow us to portray with utmost precision the life of our population. It means that we should question the selected members of your household older than 18.</p>
<p>All information, accumulated by the current study is anonymous. We undertake to never, under no circumstances to name publicly those who take part in our study. All data will by analyzed in general terms.</p>
<p>Your participation in the project is voluntary. However each refusal to participate has a negative effect on the degree of precision. Now our society needs precise information as never before.Therefore we want you or other member of your family to spend some time and give answers to our questions.</p>
