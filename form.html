It is impossible to to every day to the library unless you are a librarian. It is hard to go visiting friends every day or drink everyday in the company of friends. I would suggest that we divide pastimes in “frequent” and “infrequent” and divise different scales for them. Going to a cafe, taking sports, playing computer games would be “frequent”, admitting of every day engagement. Theater, concert, libraries, guests would be “infrequentl” pastimes. For them we can have &quot;less frequently than once a month, 2-3 times a month, 4-5 times a month, 6-7 times a month, more than 7 times a month.</a></li>

<p>Hello, my name is <strong>[Interviewer! Introduce yourself]</strong>. The Institute of Sociology of the Russian Academy of Sciences is conducting a survey that set out to collect data on how the economic and political change influence that life of the Russians. We select families in accordance with a special method, so that several thousand interviews allow us to portray with utmost precision the life of our population. It means that we should question the selected members of your household older than 18.</p>
<p>All information, accumulated by the current study is anonymous. We undertake to never, under no circumstances to name publicly those who take part in our study. All data will by analyzed in general terms.</p>
<p>Your participation in the project is voluntary. However each refusal to participate has a negative effect on the degree of precision. Now our society needs precise information as never before. Therefore we want you or other member of your family to spend some time and give answers to our questions.</p>

<p>Have you been member of following organisation during the Soviet period? Comment by MIkhail Chernysh: what about Pioneer’s organization. A large number of contemporary Russians never reached Komsomol but ended their Communist career with the Pioneers. It is part of their habitus. One more point: membership did not mean much. It was more important to be an active member, a part of the hierarchy - member of the Committee on the enterprise, or local. In other words, there should be a dividing line between “careersts” and unimportant “members”. I do not understand why we need a sports association here. Sport clubs? But they had nothing to do with the Communicst organizations. I was a member of the “Torpedo” club, played badminton for it. It was a merry-go-round kind of organization with absolutely no ideology in it. What do we mean by women’s organizations? There was the so-called Soviet women’s committee, but otherwise there were no specific women’s organizations. Trade unions: every working Soviet citizen was a member of trade unions. I meant you had to pay dues and in exchange could touch on some resources. All of it was largely automatic. Some Soviets did not even know that they were members of some trade unions.</p>

<p>Some people think that trade-unions are not necessary in modern world, but things are better agree at company-level or privately. Others argue that trade-unions are inevitable to articulate and defend the interests of the employees in the issues of wages, work conditions and equality. What is your opinion about trade-unions? Comment by Mikhail Chernysh: how many options do we give the respondent? The choice is not contradictory, so the respondent may believe that trade unions are not important and at the same time claim that trade unions are tools in the hands of management. In fact there is a logic in such a position. I sugget that we ask one more question: What is the role of trade union in your organization. Is is more a tool in the hands of management or more a defender of the rights of workers. In the options there should also be 1) it is inactive, 2) it reports to higher trade union organization, not to workers or managers. ———————————————————————————————————-</p>

I would suggest that we divide pastimes in “frequent” and “infrequent” and divise different scales for them.
